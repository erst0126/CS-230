-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

For the purposes of this class, I worked as a tech consultant for Creative Technology Solutions(CTS). The Gaming Room was a new client who was wanting to develop a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, that could serve multiple platforms. Their staff didn't know how to set up the enviornment, so they enlisted me and the company I worked for to help streamline the development of the new web-based design.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Of course there is always room for improvement, but I do think I did good in several parts of this document. To pick one, I think comparing the different traditional OSs and describing their pros and cons was something that i did pretty well. It definitely would help the client see the differences and similarities for each and help them pick the one that would work best for the requirements they need to meet.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Actually, I found the whole thing quite helpful. Stating the problem and the requirements that need to be met helps to focus on making the application meet or exceed the expectations of the customer, and comparing and contrasting all the OSs that can be used in the production helps the client to pick the one that will best fit the needs of them and their users.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the part where I recommened the OS that I thought would work best. I don't disagree with the decision I made, but I know that knowing more specific requirements and doing more research could have concluded that a different OS could have worked better than Windows.
